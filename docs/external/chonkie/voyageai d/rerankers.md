A reranker, given a query and many documents, returns the (ranks of) relevancy between the query and documents. The documents oftentimes are the preliminary results from an embedding-based retrieval system, and the reranker refines the ranks of these candidate documents and provides more accurate relevancy scores.

Unlike [embedding](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings) models that encode queries and documents separately, rerankers are [cross-encoders](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) that jointly process a pair of query and document, enabling more accurate relevancy prediction. Thus, it is a common practice to apply a reranker on the top candidates retrieved with embedding-based search (or with lexical search algorithms such as [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) and [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)).

_Older models_

The following are our earlier models, which are still accessible from our API. We recommend using the new models above for better quality and efficiency. Our latest models listed in the above table will be strictly better than the legacy models in all aspects, such as quality, context length, latency, and throughput.

| Model | Context Length (tokens) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rerank-2` | 16,000 | Our generalist second-generation reranker optimized for quality with multilingual support. See [blog post](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/09/30/rerank-2/) for details. |
| `rerank-2-lite` | 8000 | Our generalist second-generation reranker optimized for both latency and quality with multilingual support. See [blog post](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/09/30/rerank-2/) for details. |
| `rerank-1` | 8000 | Our generalist first-generation reranker optimized for quality. Multilingual support. See [blog post](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/05/29/voyage-rerank-1-cutting-edge-general-purpose-and-multilingual-reranker/) for details. |

# Python API   [Skip link to Python API](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/reranker\#python-api)

Voyage reranker is accessible in Python through the `voyageai` package. Please first [install the `voyageai` package and setup the API key](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/api-key-and-installation).

Voyage reranker receives as input a query and a list of candidate documents, e.g., the documents retrieved by a nearest neighbor search with embeddings. It reranks the candidate documents according to their semantic relevances to the search query, and returns the list of relevance scores. To access the reranker, create a [`voyageai.Client`](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/api-key-and-installation#voyageaiclient) object and use its `rerank()` method.

> [`voyageai.Client.rerank`](https://github.com/voyage-ai/voyageai-python/blob/602ba757eb2e072c95e765f9b83992affbb4ea41/voyageai/client.py#L56) ` (query: str, documents: List[str], model: str, top_k: Optional[int] = None, truncation: bool = True)`

**Parameters**

- **query** (str) - The query as a string. The query can contain a maximum of 8,000 tokens for `rerank-2.5` and `rerank-2.5-lite`, 4,000 tokens for `rerank-2`, 2,000 tokens for `rerank-2-lite` and `rerank-1`, and 1,000 tokens for `rerank-lite-1`. For `rerank-2.5` and `rerank-2.5-lite`, optional instructions can be appended or prepended to the query to better guide the relevance.
- **documents** (List\[str\]) - The documents to be reranked as a list of strings.

  - The number of documents cannot exceed 1,000.
  - The sum of the number of tokens in the query and the number of tokens in any single document cannot exceed 32,000 for `rerank-2.5` and `rerank-2.5-lite`, 16,000 for `rerank-2`; 8,000 for `rerank-2-lite` and `rerank-1`; and 4,000 for `rerank-lite-1`.
  - The total number of tokens, defined as "the number of query tokens × the number of documents + sum of the number of tokens in all documents", cannot exceed 600K for `rerank-2.5`, `rerank-2.5-lite`, `rerank-2` and `rerank-2-lite`; and 300K for `rerank-1` and `rerank-lite-1`. Please see our [FAQ](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/faq#what-is-the-total-number-of-tokens-for-the-rerankers).
- **model** (str) - Name of the model. Recommended options: `rerank-2.5`, `rerank-2.5-lite`.
- **top\_k** (int, optional, defaults to `None`) \- The number of most relevant documents to return. If not specified, the reranking results of all documents will be returned.
- **truncation** (bool, optional, defaults to `True`) \- Whether to truncate the input to satisfy the "context length limit" on the query and the documents.

  - If `True`, the query and documents will be truncated to fit within the context length limit, before processed by the reranker model.
  - If `False`, an error will be raised when the query exceeds 8,000 tokens for `rerank-2.5` and `rerank-2.5-lite`; 4,000 tokens for `rerank-2`; 2,000 tokens `rerank-2-lite` and `rerank-1`; and 1,000 tokens for `rerank-lite-1`, or the sum of the number of tokens in the query and the number of tokens in any single document exceeds 16,000 for `rerank-2`; 8,000 for `rerank-2-lite` and `rerank-1`; and 4,000 for `rerank-lite-1`.

**Returns**

- A `RerankingObject`, containing the following attributes:

  - **results** (ListrankingResult `]) - ) - A list of ` RerankingResult `, with format specified below, sorted by the descending order of relevance scores. The length of the list equals to top\_k if this argument is specified, otherwise the number of the input documents. Each element in the list is a ` RerankingResult\` object, which contains attributes:

    - **index** (int) - The index of the document in the input list.
    - **document** (str) - The document as a string.
    - **relevance\_score** (float) - The relevance score of the document with respect to the query.
  - **total\_tokens** (int) - The total number of tokens in the input, which is defined as "the number of query tokens × the number of documents + sum of the number of tokens in all documents".
