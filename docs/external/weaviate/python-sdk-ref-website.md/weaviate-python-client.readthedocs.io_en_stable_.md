[![Build Status](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client/actions/workflows/main.yaml)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/weaviate-client.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/weaviate-client)

The Weaviate Python client makes it easy to work with [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an AI Native vector database. The client is tested for Python 3.8 and higher.

The current major version is **v4** while the older **v3** client is deprecated and should be avoided. You can find further documentation for both versions:

- [Python Client v4](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python)

- [Python Client v3](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python_v3) (deprecated)


Note

Follow the [Weaviate Quickstart guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart) to get up and running quickly.

## Installation [](https://weaviate-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\#installation "Link to this heading")

You can install the Weaviate Python client using pip:

```
pip install -U weaviate-client

```

See the [installation section](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#installation) in the main Weaviate documentation for more details.

## Optional: Weaviate Agents [](https://weaviate-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\#optional-weaviate-agents "Link to this heading")

This client supports optional integration with [Weaviate Agents](https://weaviate.io/developers/agents/), which are agentic pre-built services designed to simplify common LLM-related tasks like querying, transformation, and personalization using your Weaviate data.

To install the client with agent support, use the `[agents]` extra:

```
pip install -U "weaviate-client[agents]"

```

For detailed guides and usage examples for the different agents, please refer to the main [Weaviate Agents documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/agents/).

Note

Weaviate Agents require a connection to a [Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/) instance, local instances are not supported.
