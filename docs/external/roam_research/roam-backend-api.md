- ### **Authentication**
    - Requests to the API use graph specific tokens for authentication
    - You can only get/create these if you own the graph i.e. if you're the admin of the graph
    - These start with `roam-graph-token-`
    - You can create and edit roam-graph-tokens from a new section "API tokens" in the "Graph" tab in the Settings
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froamteam%2FkqaM1ePPbV.png?alt=media&token=e113f2b5-4fbe-4b75-8d30-a114a6aa0f8d)
    - How to pass the tokens in the request?
        - pass them in the `X-Authorization` header
            - you can use the `Authorization` header too (would be more secure) but you have to make sure that your code/library [handles redirect properly](((Xz7wUMXp4))) and [passes the authorization header when redirect has been followed](((alavRpv0c))) (and the latter is generally not default behavior for most network libraries)
        - Make sure they're prefixed with a `Bearer `
        - An example
            - `Bearer roam-graph-token-t_OjqgIAH1JZphzP4HxjJNad55lLFKpsqIM7x3bW`
    - To use the Backend API, you need a roam-graph-token with either a "read+edit" or a "read-only" role
        - roam-graph-tokens with "append-only" roles can only be used with the [[Roam Append API (Beta)]]
- A [[cURL]] request example
    - ```shell
      curl -X POST "https://api.roamresearch.com/api/graph/MY-GRAPH/q" --location-trusted \
      -H  "accept: application/json" \
      -H  "X-Authorization: Bearer roam-graph-token-for-MY-GRAPH-1JN132hnXUYIfso22" \
      -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"query\" : \"[:find ?block-uid ?block-str :in \$ ?search-string :where [?b :block/uid ?block-uid] [?b :block/string ?block-str] [(clojure.string/includes? ?block-str ?search-string)]]\", \"args\": [\"apple\"]}"
      ```
        - queries a graph named "MY-GRAPH" given a datalog `query` and `args`
    - Some important points
        - `--location-trusted` is required because your request is redirected to the actual machine doing the work.
            - More info
                - There is a sharding mechanism in place (such that different graphs run on different machines)
                - `https://api.roamresearch.com/` abstracts away this from the developer point of view, by redirecting messages to the actual machine doing the work
        - As mentioned earlier in **Authentication**, you have to make sure that the tokens are prefixed with a `Bearer ` and are passed in the [Authorization header](((BYUs1ciDy)))

        - `/api/graph/{graph-name}/write` (POST)
            - We have a **single endpoint** for all the different [write actions](((IEmaIxzTU))). The way you differentiate between the actions is by passing the name of the action as value for the `action` key (alongside all the other required parameters)
            - Showcase Example:
                - Look at the params for `create-block` write action:
                    - Parameters::
                        - `location`
                            - `parent-uid` **required**
                            - `order` **required**
                        - `block`
                            - `string` **required**
                            - `uid` **optional**
                            - `open` **optional**
                            - `heading` **optional**
                            - `text-align` **optional**
                            - `children-view-type` **optional**
                - This is what we would pass in the request body
                    - ```javascript
                      {
                          "action" : "create-block",
                          "location": {
                              "parent-uid": "09-28-2022",
                              "order": "last"
                          },
                          "block": {
                              "string": "new block created via the backend",
                              "open": false,
                              "heading": 2,
                              "text-align": "right",
                              "children-view-type": "document"
                          }
                      }
                      ```
                        - you can see that we're passing "action" alongside the parameters "location" and "block" (which are from the action specific params above)
                - Full writeup of a write request to the backend
                    - Example request showing all the possible properties (you can always omit the **optional** params if not needed)
                        - This request creates a new block with given string in given location and sets its open state, makes it a heading 2, makes it align right and sets the children to be shown as a document

                                        - Example:: if we pass `"order": 2` in the [update-block example request](((PXb7H9prc)))

                                    1. When input format error / invalid parameter values
                                        - Example:: if we pass `"order": 2` in the [update-block example request](((PXb7H9prc)))

                                    2. If [write request](((J-hxpYKmK))) fails
                                        - For `batch-actions` especially, You have to carefully handle this (to know how many requests suceeded)
                                            - Please checkout **What happens on failure of any particular action in the batch action?**
                                                - We validate arguments for all actions first, then transact/handle the actions one after another in sequence. If there is an error transacting the action, we bail on it and all subsequent actions.
                                                  This means that out of the `n` actions in a batch action request, the first `x` could succeed/transact and if then error occurs, the remaining `n-x` ones would not happen
                                                    - you can use `num-actions-successfully-transacted-before-failure` to figure out where exactly in the actions list the error happened
                                    3. When one is trying to use an Encrypted graph
                                        - Encrypted graphs are NOT supported by the [[Roam Backend API (Beta)]]
                                    4. When no graph name in request, or invalid graph name
                                    5. If invalid write action
                                    6. When token cannot be verified or improperly formatted
                            - 401 UNAUTHORIZED #important
                                - If one is unauthorized or if one does not have required access to the graph (read/write)
                                - Please note that in some cases, When token cannot be verified or improperly formatted returns a 400 BAD REQUEST #important
                                    - this is a bug on our part, but changing it now could break existing integrations, so leaving it like this for this version of the API
                            - 404 NOT FOUND
                                - If the API route you're calling is not found
                                    - i.e. if you request an API route NOT in **API routes**
                            - 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS #important
                                - When you run into the per graph limit/quota. See **Graph-specific Usage Quotas**

                    - **What happens on failure of any particular action in the batch action?**
                        - We validate arguments for all actions first, then transact/handle the actions one after another in sequence. If there is an error transacting the action, we bail on it and all subsequent actions.
                          This means that out of the `n` actions in a batch action request, the first `x` could succeed/transact and if then error occurs, the remaining `n-x` ones would not happen
                            - you can use `num-actions-successfully-transacted-before-failure` to figure out where exactly in the actions list the error happened
                        - Error's `response.body` contains
                            - `message`
                                - the error message relevant to the failing action
                                - If you have a batch action with a number of create-blocks and one fails, `message` could have a value like `"Error in create-block: Block already exists"`
                                    - So, this is the specific error that happened
                                    - If you want to understand the error at a higher level, please checkout the `batch-error-message`
                            - `num-actions-successfully-transacted-before-failure`
                                - **important**
                                - If batch action had 5 txs and the 3rd action failed, this means the first 2 actions were successfully transacted. In this case, `num-actions-successfully-transacted-before-failure` would be `2`
                                - This value is useful in case you want to retry the action and do not want to redo the actions (in the start of the list) which have already been done successfully
                            - `batch-error-message`
                                - Error message which gives a more holistic view of what went wrong in the context of the whole batch action.
                                    - Is different from `message` because `message` returns the technical thing that went wrong, while `batch-error-message` is more on a meta level
                                - Some examples of what this might look like
                                    - "Error during validation of the batch-action. No actions were successful/transacted."
                                    - "Error partway through handling a batch-actions request. The first `num-actions-successfully-transacted-before-failure` actions were successful/transacted. The action immediately after that is the one that failed."

                - Common [[Resources]] For [[Example]]s
                    - Example Endpoint: `/api/graph/MY-GRAPH/write` (POST)
    - **What does response look like?** (with **HTTP status codes**)
        - Returns::
            - (If you're building an integration, be sure to implement at least the response codes below)
            - 200 OK #important
                - if successful
                - If [q](((vbEj2bZql))) request , see sample output structure
                - if [pull](((hVxZlW31i))) request, see sample output structure
                - if [write](((J-hxpYKmK))) request, 200 status code in response means all done
            - 308 PERMANENT REDIRECT
                - the API endpoint for backend API i.e. **Endpoint base url:** https://api.roamresearch.com/ actually returns the actual URL you want to hit for your read/write requests
                - In many cases, the network tool/library you're using will follow the redirect without additional config on your side
            - 4XX BAD REQUEST (with error message specifying what went wrong)
                - 400 BAD REQUEST #important
                    - this error code is returned in many cases. So, please checkout response body's `message` value
                    - some cases
                        1. When input format error / invalid parameter values
                            - Example:: if we pass `"order": 2` in the [update-block example request](((PXb7H9prc)))
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdeveloper-documentation%2FCYOavPuw7p.png?alt=media&token=a1a7301b-e12a-4385-983f-3d6489a7916f)
                        2. If [write request](((J-hxpYKmK))) fails
                            - For `batch-actions` especially, You have to carefully handle this (to know how many requests suceeded)
                                - Please checkout **What happens on failure of any particular action in the batch action?**
                                    - We validate arguments for all actions first, then transact/handle the actions one after another in sequence. If there is an error transacting the action, we bail on it and all subsequent actions.
                                      This means that out of the `n` actions in a batch action request, the first `x` could succeed/transact and if then error occurs, the remaining `n-x` ones would not happen
                                        - you can use `num-actions-successfully-transacted-before-failure` to figure out where exactly in the actions list the error happened
                        3. When one is trying to use an Encrypted graph
                            - Encrypted graphs are NOT supported by the [[Roam Backend API (Beta)]]
                        4. When no graph name in request, or invalid graph name
                        5. If invalid write action
                        6. When token cannot be verified or improperly formatted
                - 401 UNAUTHORIZED #important
                    - If one is unauthorized or if one does not have required access to the graph (read/write)
                    - Please note that in some cases, When token cannot be verified or improperly formatted returns a 400 BAD REQUEST #important
                        - this is a bug on our part, but changing it now could break existing integrations, so leaving it like this for this version of the API
                - 404 NOT FOUND
                    - If the API route you're calling is not found
                        - i.e. if you request an API route NOT in **API routes**
                - 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS #important
                    - When you run into the per graph limit/quota. See **Graph-specific Usage Quotas**
                        - Currently set to __50 requests/minute/graph__
            - 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR #important ( default fallback code for errors  )
                - default fallback code for errors
                    - So, please checkout response body's `message` value
                - If you get this & message does not make clarify, please contact us at support@roamresearch.com or in the [developers slack](((PhhTUf7xj)))
                - Some cases
                    - If message contains "**took too long to run**", then the query/pull request is running into our time limit (20 seconds for now). In this case, you want to request less data or add limits.
                        - You might want to add limited recursion limits to pull specs: https://docs.datomic.com/pro/query/pull.html#recursive-specifications
            - 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE #important
                - if graph is not ready for requests yet or is unavailable at the moment. If you get this, please try again in a bit
                - Example

    - **Graph-specific Usage Quotas**
        - Currently set to __50 requests/minute/graph__
            - If you run into the limits regularly even when using the strategies mentioned below, please let us know
        - When you run into the limit/quota, server will respond with a 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS #important
            - so please account for that in your code by using timeouts etc
        - One way of reducing the number of requests you're making is to use [batch writes](((6qFz56O08)))
- ### FAQ::
    - Q:: How do I do the [--location-trusted](((Pe6pCt3Wd))) if I'm using something other than [[cURL]]?
        - The two main things
            - You want the request library to automatically follow redirects
                - this is generally the default in most libraries and applications
            - You want the authorization header to be passed when redirect has been followed
                - This is generally not default behavior, so this will probably need extra configuration
                - another approach would be to use the `X-Authorization` header instead of the `Authorization` header
                    - pass them in the `X-Authorization` header
                        - you can use the `Authorization` header too (would be more secure) but you have to make sure that your code/library [handles redirect properly](((Xz7wUMXp4))) and [passes the authorization header when redirect has been followed](((alavRpv0c))) (and the latter is generally not default behavior for most network libraries)
        - Examples
            - [[Python]]
                - some examples, courtesy of [[Matt Vogel]]: https://gist.github.com/8bitgentleman/75561ac116b5b925fd58ff595389d591
            - [[Postman]] client: https://www.postman.com/
                - Postman already fulfills [criteria 1](((Xz7wUMXp4))): it automatically follows redirects
                    - If it doesn't for you, you have to go to the settings and enable "Automatically follow redirects"
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdeveloper-documentation%2Fe-TlApoRVQ.png?alt=media&token=4a136983-a944-4000-98ee-84057b2c2f16)
                - For criteria 2 i..e passing authorization header on redirect, that is a per "request" setting and it can be enabled in the request level settings > Follow Authorization Header
                    - If you don't do this, you will get a `"message": "You are not authenticated"` response from the server, which is super confusing unless you go to the console and really look at the requests
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdeveloper-documentation%2FnC3atvLkRc.png?alt=media&token=4ed94fa2-fcaf-420e-b2ad-ee3315aa7f40)
    - Q:: I can't get the request to work using `fetch` or equivalent in my roam/js (i.e. in the browser)
        - A:: Yes, this is a known issue due to a bunch of CORS and preflight requests issues. So, right now, that is not possible. We plan on exposing functions in the client-side [[Roam Alpha API]] to make this possible
