    "text": "\n    Seventy thousand years ago, there were six different human species roaming the earth, and each one's impact was just as insignificant on the planet as say, jellyfish, gorillas, or dragonflies. So how did homo sapiens not only survive, but proceed to thrive and take over the world?\n    One book's unique answer to this question made it the instant favorite of [[Bill Gates]], [[Barack Obama]], and [million others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind#Reception).  \n      In [[Sapiens]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] looks at multiple fields ((like history, biology, philosophy and economics))--both from a birds-eye view and from up close-- to [explain](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-of-Humankind):\n        > We want to believe that there is something special about the human body or human brain that makes each individual human vastly superior to a dog, or a pig, or a chimpanzee. We look for the differences on the individual level.\n\nBut the fact is that one-on-one, humans are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. If you place me and a chimpanzee together on a lone island, to see who survives better, I would definitely place my bets on the chimp.\n\nThe real difference between us and other animals is on the collective level: **Homo sapiens has the special ability to unite millions of strangers around commons myths. **\n\nWe are the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and bees can also work together in large numbers, but they do so in a very rigid way. If a beehive is facing a new threat or a new opportunity, the bees cannot reinvent their social system overnight in order to cope better. They cannot, for example, execute the queen and establish a republic. \n\nWolves and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small numbers of intimately known individuals. Among wolves and chimps, cooperation is based on personal acquaintance. If I am a chimp and I want to cooperate with you, I must know you personally: What kind of chimp are you? Are you a nice chimp? Are you an evil chimp? How can I cooperate with you if I don\u2019t know you?\n\nOne-on-one or ten-on-ten, chimpanzees may be better than us. But pit 1,000 Sapiens against 1,000 chimps, and the Sapiens will win easily, for the simple reason that 1,000 chimps can never cooperate effectively. Put 100,000 chimps in Wall Street or Yankee Stadium, and you\u2019ll get chaos. Put 100,000 humans there, and you\u2019ll get trade networks and sports contests.\n",
